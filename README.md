XIOTCore is a framework to assist you to develop IOT applications on Windows 10 IOT Core. It allows you to get your projects up and running very quickly so you can concentrate on your thing rather than being bogged down with boilerplate code. 

XIOT is based around Autofac dependency injection, so you can build simple apps right up to the most advanced applications without having to add any complexity. Just inject your device and start using it!

Becasue of XIOT's design around [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) it can support multiple different platforms wihtout you having to change your code (much!). This allows you to work on both a Raspberry PI2 and an FTDI style device from your PC. 






* 
* Support for Raspberry PI2 running Windows 10 IOT Core
* Support for FTDI (FT232H) USB for rapid development of circuits and logic from your PC
..* I2C, SPI (GPIO coming soon)
* Supports the built in Windows 10 IOT classes like I2C, GPIO etc
